>This software helps you add a little more security to your
desktop. It does so by detecting one of your bluetooth devices, 
most likely your mobile phone, and keeping track of its distance.

>## Note from the maintainer of this fork ##
>This current version (1.3.3) only upgraded the original code to make it run in Python 3 / GTK+ 3.
I have respected the original work from Lars Friedrichs as much as possible.
In the future, if there's interest on this software I might continue developing it under a new name. Just let me know :-)

## Description from the original author
>If you move away from your computer and the distance is above
a certain level for a 
given time, it automatically locks your desktop 
(or starts any other shell command you want).

>Once away your computer awaits its master back - if you are 
nearer than a given level for a set time your computer unlocks 
magically without any interaction 
(or starts any other shell command you want).

>See the doc/ directory or the website which both contain
a manual with screenshots.

>Please note that there might still some bugs, use the sourceforge 
site to keep track of them or tell me about new ones not mentioned 
there. 
>Please read the whole manual - it's short enough, hopefully easy 
understandable and hey - it even got some pretty pictures in there
too :-)

## Installation
Note from the maintainer of this fork (RGM):
>For the moment, this application hasn't been packaged for installation as a .deb or .rpm.
If you know how to do it, please reach out and I'll include such packages!

### Arch Linux Package (maintained by: [Laurent OF Fough](https://github.com/LaurentFough))
+ AUR Package available here: [AUR/ blueproximity-py3-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/blueproximity-py3-git/)

#### Installation via yay|trizen, etc: (_* Package is marked as conflicting with the Python2 version, to avoid having both installed_)
- > `$ yay -S blueproximity-py3-git`

## Development setup

Create a virtual environment for Python 3.8 and install the 
required libraries using the requirements.txt file.

```sh
cd my-blueproximity-project/
virtualenv --python=python3.8 venvs/venv3.8
source venvs/venv3.8/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
Note from the 'maintainer' of this fork (RGM):
>The only important configuration for this version is to set the correct path where the software will be installed.
If you download this software and you run it as a local user from a folder in your home directory,
then you don't have to change anything. But if you're creating an installation package for a distribution,
please take care of setting the right path in the variable dist_path that you will find at the beginning of the 
proximity.py script.
